    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I turned around to Stephane and said, &ldquo;I think the world is ready for my thoughts&rdquo;. He said you mean you are ready to expose your thoughts. I thought about that for a second, and realized how true that is. I have been wanting to start a blog since a year now, but I always kept delaying it because I was scared of what people might think. In reality nobody cares about you, all they think about is themselves.</p>

<p>I have finally reached that state of mind, where I don&rsquo;t mind putting myself out there. This blog is mainly going to be about the things I learn and my ramblings.</p>
