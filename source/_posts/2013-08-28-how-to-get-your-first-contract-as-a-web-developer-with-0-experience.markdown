Just after graduating from [Dev Bootcamp][1], I was discussing with my friend that it would be awesome to get some contract work and get my feet wet in the world of software engineering. I had just spent the last few days, refining my [Github][2], [Linkedin][3] & [Angel's list][4]. At that moment I got an email from a friend, saying that his friend wants a developer to help build a website for them. I jumped at that opportunity. It has been a blast building [LetsFeast][5] from scratch.

Recently I read a [Quora answer][6] on career advice:
>Fill out the application.

>Because sometimes your fears of opportunity are the only actual thing preventing you from getting your dream job, that business loan or a new home. Sometimes you sit and look at the jobs website a dozen times thinking that you don't want to face the fear of rejection and you never do it. Sometimes you think to yourself that if they were to hire you, you would surely fail. Sometimes you think about the change in your life and what it might mean. Sometimes you might turn out to be more scared of the change than you are with the situation you want so badly to change. This is why you are still there asking what is good advice for your career.

>Sometimes the best things in life are huge and terrifying, different and drenched with change, but they require you to take that step in the middle of one night. You click that button, fill out that form, make the call, send the email. Take the chance, take the risk and fail. Fail until you finally get the call back, which never comes to the very scared person who never filled out the application.

You have spent the last few months learning how to code, building stuff and now want to tackle projects which can help you gain experience&money. All the advice out there for getting your first contract base it on the fact that you have worked as a developer before. But this article is targeted towards someone who has never worked as one. So how do you get the first job? 

Where do I begin?

The most common answer over here would be to leverage your existing networks. Let people know that you are now building websites for money, or looking for a company which can benefit from your services. This can lead to connections which you can utilize to get jobs. Even if the least you get out of this is a conversation, that is a good start. 
If nobody in your existing circle provides you with any connections, you can always try [Meetup][7]

The next step is to apply to freelance job sites. Before you do that, if you haven't already, spend a few days making a [personal website][8] & your [resume][9]. You might say that you rather spend this time coding, and I agree with that, but this will be extremely beneficial to you once you get it done. Once you complete that ask friends&family for advice. Keep tweaking it until you are happy with it. The idea for here is to stand out in some way. Let's face it, the odds are against you that is why you need to different in someway and show that you are capable for that particular job.

List of freelance websites:

-[Elance][10]
-[Freelancer][11]
-[ODesk][12]

Make accounts on all of these websites. Fill out all the details. Now the search begins.
Filter the search by your expertise. Select a few jobs that you think you can handle. Let's start with 5. 

You need experience! In other fields take accounting for example. It's hard to get experience unless you are employed somewhere. As an aspiring developer, it's very easy to gain experience as long as you make a conscious effort towards it. 
I have spoken about this over here.


In the end it is a number game

 The more you apply the higher your chances become of getting a yes. Be realistic over here don't apply to things that you know you will not be able to fulfill. Eventually somebody will say yes. 

Apply, apply and apply more. I can't stress this point enough. It's easy to fall into the trap and convince yourself that you are not good enough. Well that might be true, but practice makes perfect. It took me a while to muster up the courage to apply, and once I did I was shocked how easy it was. The following places you can apply. 


**Now the trick here is to convince people that despite not having a lot of real world experience, you are capable enough and passionate.** This depends on person to person, but this was the application I sent out for my first real work as a contract developer. 

While focusing on the applications don't forget about coding. This should still be your main priority. 

People always want their site optimized or built. It's laughable how easy it is to obtain work as a developer in today's world.

Work your ass off
