I turned around to Stephane and said, "I think the world is ready for my thoughts." He said, you mean you are ready to expose your thoughts to the world. I thought about that for a second, and realized how true that is. I have been wanting to start a blog since a year now, but I kept delaying it because I was afraid about what people might think. In reality nobody cares about you, all they think about is themselves.
Enough of that bullshit. I have finally reached a state of mind, where I don't mind putting myself out there. 

Tell me about Yourself.
-----------------
The interview question I dread.
Recently graduated from high school in Dubai. Wandered for a few months and initially decided to not follow the traditional path of college. Completed Dev Bootcamp, a 9 week intensive course on web development, on April 19th 2013. Currently an aspiring web developer. I love learning and exploring new things.
This is a brief overview of my journey over the past couple of years, read the whole account here.

My writings are going to be about the things I learn and my ramblings. Mainly about my journey as a software developer.
